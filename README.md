# PolyForce

**A polyphonic wavetable synthesizer that runs natively inside MPC on the Akai Force.**

PolyForce is a VST2 instrument for MPC OS's built-in plugin host, with its own touchscreen pages
and Q-Link sets. Its feature set tips its hat to a certain *buzzing* desktop wavetable synth 🐝,
squeezed into the CPU budget of a standalone groovebox. The name, DSP, wavetables and presets are
all PolyForce's own.

> [!NOTE]
> **Preview.** Milestones 1–7 are complete and pass the full test suite on x86 and under ARM
> emulation. It runs on an Akai Force (MPC OS 3.x): the pages, browser and buttons have been
> checked on the device, a full on-device test round is still to come. The plugin ID (`PlFc`) and
> the file name (`polyforce.so`) stay; the parameter list may still change before v0.1.

## Highlights

- **8 voices** · Poly, Duo, Mono and Legato · four steal modes with click-free fades · glide
- **Two wavetable oscillators** with up to 8× unison, classic waves, sub oscillators and a noise source
- **Two filters** — LP, BP, HP, notch, peak, comb and vowel — serial or parallel, three engine characters
- **Deep modulation** — two LFOs, a 12-slot matrix (28 sources, 36 targets) with modifiers, four XY pads
- **Arpeggiator, 16-step sequencer and four shape sequencers**, locked to MPC's transport
- **30 built-in wavetables** — analog, FM, digital, vocal, acoustic and chip — plus your own
  (Serum-format WAVs and hardware-style tables such as Access Virus TI exports) from the plugin folder or the SSD, with a browser, favorites and recents
- **205 factory presets** in 14 categories, level-matched; user presets, Init and Randomize,
  `.tun` / `.scl` microtuning
- **Built for the Force's CPU** — NEON vectorisation, a profile-guided build, and a CPU guard that
  sheds release tails before the audio drops out

Effects are deliberately left out: use MPC's insert effects on the track.

## Requirements

- An **Akai Force**. Other first-generation (32-bit ARM) MPC OS devices may work but are untested.
- **Root SSH access** to the device (for example through MockbaMod). Stock MPC OS has no way to
  install third-party plugins.
- **MPC OS 3.x** for the touchscreen pages. Release builds need glibc 2.30, so MPC OS 2.x loads them
  too, but it doesn't draw third-party plugin pages yet.

## Installation

Use a release package (`PolyForce-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip`, built by CI: every run of the
[build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) keeps one), or build one with `make plugin-package`
(see [Building](docs/BUILDING.md)). Unzip it and follow the `INSTALL.md`
inside. In short:

```sh
scp -r PolyForce-<version> root@<device-ip>:/tmp/
ssh root@<device-ip> sh /tmp/PolyForce-<version>/install.sh
```

The installer **stops MPC** (save your project first), copies the plugin into `/sdcard/Synths`,
backs up and edits `MPC.settings`, and starts MPC again. Running it again upgrades in place and
keeps your own wavetables, presets, tunings and favorites. Then add **PolyForce** to a track from
MPC's instrument plugins.

## Building from source

On Linux or WSL (developed on Ubuntu 24.04):

```sh
make test            # the full test suite under ASan/UBSan
make arm-plugin      # build/arm/polyforce.so for the device
make plugin-package  # dist/PolyForce-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip
```

Toolchain, every make target and the on-device bench are described in
[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).
