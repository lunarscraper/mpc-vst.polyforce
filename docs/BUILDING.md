## Requirements

PolyForce builds on Linux or WSL; it is developed on Ubuntu 24.04.

| Tool | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `g++` 13 | tests and the x86 bench |
| `arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++` 11 or newer | the device build (libstdc++ is linked dynamically; MPC OS ships it). Release builds come from [CI](#release-builds) |
| GNU make ≥ 4.3 | everything |
| `python3` | generating the parameter list, layout and C++ headers from `surface/surface.py` |
| `gcc` | the skin generator's C renderer |
| Python 3 with Pillow (`PY=`) | the skin, the page previews and the release package |
| `qemu-user` (`qemu-arm`) | `test-arm`, `test-arm-pgo` and the profile-guided device build |
| `ssh`, `scp` | `bench-device`, `plugin-install` |

On Ubuntu 24.04, for example:

```sh
sudo apt install g++ g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf make python3 python3-pil qemu-user
```

## Quick start

```sh
make test                      # the full suite under ASan/UBSan
make arm-plugin                # build/arm/polyforce.so
make skin preview              # the skin, and every page as surface/build/page_*.png
make plugin-package            # dist/PolyForce-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip
```

`surface/surface.py` is the single source of the parameter list and the touchscreen pages. Every
build regenerates `params.json`, `layout.conf`, `vst.json` and the C++ headers from it when it
changes; it checks the layout and every factory preset before writing anything.

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `surface` | Regenerate parameters, layout and C++ headers from `surface/surface.py` (automatic) |
| `skin` | Build the skin (`TUI.json` + PNGs) with the vendored generator, then polish it with `surface/skin_polish.py` |
| `preview` | Render every page as `surface/build/page_*.png` |
| `test` | The ASan/UBSan suite; uses `$(WAVETABLES)` for the import check |
| `test-arm` | The same suite built for the Force's CPU, run under `qemu-arm` |
| `test-arm-pgo` | The suite linked against the profile-guided objects the shipped `.so` is made of |
| `test-tables` | Load, check and play every WAV under `$(WAVETABLES)`, with load time and memory |
| `bench` | x86 bench: only proves the bench and the profiling build work |
| `loudness` | Every factory preset's loudness (BS.1770) and peak, played through the plugin; flags peaks over −1 dBFS (`LOUDNESS_ARGS`: `-g <dB>` a level shift, `-c <category>`) |
| `arm-plugin` | `build/arm/polyforce.so`; profile-guided when `qemu-arm` is installed |
| `arm-bench-stages` | `build/arm/polyforce_stages.so`, the profiling build (never shipped) |
| `bench-device` | Run the CPU bench on a device (see [below](#benchmarking-on-the-device)) |
| `plugin-package` | `dist/PolyForce-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip` with the installer |
| `plugin-install` | Package, copy to the device and install (stops and restarts MPC) |
| `clean` | Remove `build/` and `surface/build/` |

`make` on its own runs the tests and builds the device `.so` and the x86 profiling build.

## Make variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FORCE` | The device's SSH address, `root@<ip>`; required by `bench-device` and `plugin-install` |
| `SSH_KEY` | Private key for the device's root login (default: ssh's own keys and config) |
| `PY` | Python 3 with Pillow, for `skin`, `preview` and `plugin-package` (default `python3`) |
| `WAVETABLES` | Folder of sample wavetables for the tests and the bench (default `../wavetables`) |
| `PGO` | `auto` (default): profile-guided when `qemu-arm` is installed; `1`: always; `0`: plain build |
| `PLUGIN_VERSION` | Version in the package name |
| `BENCH_ARGS`, `BENCH_MATRIX_ARGS`, `BENCH_STAGE_ARGS` | `pfbench` arguments for the three `bench-device` runs |
| `TABLE` | The large table for the bench (default: the first WAV of 2 MB or more under `WAVETABLES`) |

Pass variables on the command line, or keep your own in `local.mk` next to the Makefile (git
ignores it):

```make
FORCE      = root@192.168.0.10
SSH_KEY    = $(HOME)/.ssh/force
PY         = $(HOME)/.venvs/polyforce/bin/python
WAVETABLES = $(HOME)/wavetables
```

## Tests

`make test` drives the whole plugin through its VST2 entry points against a fake MPC host
(`test/host.h`), under AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. There is one test file per
milestone (`test/m1_test.cpp` … `m7_test.cpp`), `plugin_test.cpp` for the plugin glue, and
`review_test.cpp` with a regression check for every finding of the code reviews.

`make test-arm` runs the same suite cross-compiled for the Force's CPU under `qemu-arm` (no
sanitizers). It catches 32-bit and ARM-only paths: the denormal flush, NEON vectorisation.

### Sample wavetables

The import check and `make test-tables` need a folder of Serum-format WAVs. Sample tables are
third-party content: keep them **outside** the repository, never commit or package them. Without
them the import check is skipped. Point `WAVETABLES` at your folder if it isn't `../wavetables`:

```sh
make test WAVETABLES=~/wavetables
```

### Environment overrides

| Variable | Replaces |
|---|---|
| `PF_TABLE_ROOTS` | The wavetable roots (colon-separated list) |
| `PF_PRESET_ROOTS` | The preset roots |
| `PF_TUNING_ROOTS` | The tuning roots |
| `PF_DATA_DIR` | Where favorites and recent lists are kept |
| `PF_CPU_GUARD=0` | Turns the CPU guard off (the test suite does) |
| `PF_WAVETABLES` | The folder the import check reads (`make test` sets it from `WAVETABLES`) |
| `PF_TRACE_DIR` | Where the [diagnostics](#diagnostics-on-the-device) flag and log are (default `/tmp`) |

## Benchmarking on the device

```sh
make bench-device FORCE=root@<ip> WAVETABLES=<folder>
```

Copies the plugin, its profiling build, the bench (`pfbench`) and one large table (the first of
2 MB or more under `WAVETABLES`) to `/tmp` on the device, runs pinned to core 1 while MPC keeps
running (MPC's audio workers own cores 2–3), then deletes them. The bench `dlopen()`s the `.so` like
MPC and times every block. It reads no user folders, saves nothing, and fails if any run fails.

Three runs:

1. the plain `.so` at 1–8 voices × 1–8 unison: the verdicts (PASS at p99 ≤ 15% of the block)
2. the same with a busy modulation matrix
3. the profiling build: time per render pass, then the same voices on the built-in table and on
   the large one, to show whether memory traffic matters

Results and what they mean: [Performance](PERFORMANCE.md).

## Packaging and installing

```sh
make plugin-package
```

Builds `dist/PolyForce-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip`: the plugin and its skin as one folder, the
installer and uninstaller, a generated `INSTALL.md` and checksums. Shipped scripts run under
BusyBox on the device, so the build refuses CRLF line endings in them.

```sh
make plugin-install FORCE=root@<ip>
```

Packages, copies the package to the device and runs its installer: it **stops MPC** (save your
project first), backs up and edits `MPC.settings`, and starts MPC again. A reinstall keeps the
user's wavetables, presets, tunings and favorites/recent lists.

## Release builds

Releases are built by CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) on every push, the way the plugin catalog's
own ports are built: the device build runs in `arm32v7/gcc:11-bullseye` (GCC 11, glibc 2.31) under
QEMU, profile-guided, with the test suite run against the objects the `.so` is linked from; the
sanitizer suite runs on x86. The zip is checked with the catalog's own checker
(`third_party/mpc-vst-plugins/tools/catalog_check.py --catalog`) and kept as the run's artifact.

Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` also publishes it as a GitHub release, which the plugin catalog lists with a
download button and its installers offer. A tag with a suffix (`v0.1.0-beta`) publishes a
prerelease instead: the catalog's beta channel, which its site shows only when a visitor ticks
"Show beta releases" and its installers never offer. The plugin's version is the tag without the
suffix. The catalog reads the major version as the parameter list's compatibility: bump X whenever
parameter indices change.

The same build outside CI, in an ARM environment: `make ARM_PREFIX= ARM_RUN= PGO=1 plugin-package`
(`ARM_PREFIX` empty: the native compiler; `ARM_RUN` empty: ARM programs run directly).

A local build with a newer distribution's cross compiler (Ubuntu 24.04: 64-bit `time_t` by default,
glibc 2.39) needs glibc 2.38. That loads on the Force and other MPC OS 3.x devices, fine for testing,
but the catalog refuses it.

## Diagnostics on the device

To see what MPC sends when a control is touched, turned or tapped, create the flag file while MPC
runs (no restart):

```sh
ssh root@<ip> touch /tmp/polyforce.trace
```

Within a second every PolyForce instance appends one line per `setParameter` to
`/tmp/polyforce.log`: the time, the instance, the parameter, the value MPC sent, the value it had
read back before and the plugin's value and text after. Remove the flag file to stop. The log stops
growing at 2 MB; `/tmp` is cleared when the device restarts.

## Binary compatibility

- The `.so` exports only `VSTPluginMain` and links with `--no-undefined`: an unresolved symbol
  would otherwise only show as MPC crashing on load.
- The [release build](#release-builds) needs glibc 2.31 or less, so it loads on MPC OS 2.x and 3.x.
  Built with a newer toolchain it needs that toolchain's glibc (Ubuntu 24.04: 2.38). The device build
  prints the highest glibc version it needs.
