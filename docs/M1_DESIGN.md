# Milestone 1 design: wavetable library, browsing, steal modes

> **Status: built** (Milestone 1, 2026-10-04). This is the design record as planned; the
> differences in the built version are listed below. For the current overview, see
> [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Decisions behind it are in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md#decisions): all browsing options (§6–7),
tables from the plugin folder **and** the SSD, all four steal modes. The touchscreen
mechanics (stepping, pushes to MPC, the tile bounce rule) come from RackForce, an earlier Force
plugin, where they are proven on the device.

What changed after this design:

- **§1** The plugin folder comes from PolyForce's own `plugin/paths.cpp` (`/proc/self/maps`), not
  the toolkit's wrapper header.
- **§3** The loader has three slots (osc 1, osc 2, tuning); it also frees replaced tables while no
  block runs, and catches anything a load throws. MISSING shows in the status line for 5 s, then
  only in the stepper text.
- **§5** Stealing fades the old voice out over 3 ms (Milestone 2); since the interface redesign
  (Milestone 7) STEAL sits on the VOICE tab.
- **§6.2** `br_osc` became `br_target` with a third option, PRESETS: the same page browses presets
  (Milestone 7). Presets and tunings use the same library and loader code (`FileLibrary`,
  `Loader::SlotType`) with their own roots and favorites/recent files.
- **§8** The state is now `polyforce 4` (real values, per-oscillator routes, tuning and preset
  keys); see `plugin/state.h`.

Still to do on the device: step 7 (all 379 tables reachable, CPU, project reload) and the
`setParameter`-after-`effSetChunk` trace from §8 (see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md#whats-next)).

Build order (each step ends green on `make test`; steps 1 and 7 also run `make bench-device`):

1. Faster, smaller import (§4)
2. Library (§1) + favorites/recent files (§7)
3. Cache + per-instance loader (§2, §3)
4. Table steppers on the OSC page + state recall (§6.1, §8)
5. Browser page (§6.2) + favorite/random/copy/swap (§7)
6. Steal modes (§5)
7. Device check: all 379 tables reachable, CPU ≤ 15% at 8 × 8, project reload restores tables

---

## 1. Library (process-wide, UI + worker threads only)

New `plugin/library.{h,cpp}`. Built once per process on first use; the audio thread never sees it.

- **Roots**, in this order:
  1. `<plugin dir>/Wavetables`, plugin dir from `third_party/.../wrapper/plugin_dir.h`
     (`mpc_plugin_dir()` reads `/proc/self/maps`; it deliberately avoids `dladdr()`, which
     would bind GLIBC_2.34).
  2. `/media/AkaiForce/Wavetables` (the SSD; `noexec` only stops binaries, WAVs are fine).
     Missing or unmounted → silently no tables from it.
  - Test override: `PF_TABLE_ROOTS` = colon-separated list replacing both.
- **Scan** = directory listing only (no WAV headers, no FFTs): `*.wav`, case-insensitive,
  recursive. Few ms for ~400 files.
- **Key** (what state and favorites store): `plugin:<relpath>`, `ssd:<relpath>`,
  `builtin:<Name>`. Never an index (indices move when files are added).
- **Category** = first path component under the root (files directly in a root: `Unsorted`).
  Same-named categories from both roots merge. Order: `★ Favorites`, `Recent`, `Built-in`,
  then folders A→Z. Inside a category: by display name, case-insensitive.
- **Display name** = file stem minus the longest prefix ending in `" - "` that every file in
  the category shares: `ESW Analog - Jupiter 8 Saw` → `Jupiter 8 Saw`. Stepper text =
  `Category / Name`.
- **Flat order** (what the knob scroll walks) = categories in order, pseudo-categories
  excluded, built-ins first.
- Guard everything with one mutex; it's touched only from MPC's UI thread and loader threads.

## 2. Cache (process-wide)

- `std::map<key, std::shared_ptr<const Wavetable>>` + LRU list + byte count, one mutex.
- `get(key)` → hit moves it to the front. `put(key, table)` then evicts from the back while
  over the cap (**96 MB**), skipping entries with `use_count() > 1` (someone plays them).
- The same table on both oscillators or in two instances is loaded once.
- Two instances missing the same key at once may both load it; the second `put` just keeps
  the first copy. Acceptable.
- Built-in tables are wrapped in a `shared_ptr` with a no-op deleter (static lifetime).

## 3. Per-instance loader and the audio-thread handoff

New `plugin/loader.{h,cpp}`, one per plugin instance, its own worker thread (started in
`VSTPluginMain`, joined in `effClose`, like RackForce's worker). Two slots, one per oscillator.

```
slot (per oscillator)
  UI thread   wantKey + wantTime (mutex)          what the user picked, when
  worker      owned  : shared_ptr<const Wavetable>   the instance's reference
              loadedKey, state (Ready/Loading/Missing), frames (atomic, for display)
  audio       live   : std::atomic<const Wavetable*>
instance      epoch  : std::atomic<uint32_t>        incremented at the END of every block
              graveyard: vector<{shared_ptr, epochAtSwap}>  (worker only)
```

- **Debounce:** the worker loads a slot only once `wantKey` has been stable for **150 ms**,
  so scrolling through 50 tables loads one.
- **Load:** cache hit or `loadWavetable()` + `put`. Failure or missing file → fall back to
  `builtin:Classic`, state Missing; **`wantKey` is kept**, so saving the project keeps the
  reference and it comes back when the file does.
- **Publish:** `old = owned; owned = new; live.store(new.get()); graveyard.push({old, epoch.load()})`.
- **Free:** the worker drops a graveyard entry once `epoch > epochAtSwap`.
  Why that is safe: the audio thread reads `live` once at block start and uses only that
  pointer until the block ends, then increments `epoch`. If it read the old pointer before the
  swap, that block hasn't ended when the worker samples `epoch`, so freeing waits for its end.
  If it read after the swap, it has the new pointer. Without blocks running (suspended),
  entries wait; `effClose` frees everything after the thread is joined.
- **Audio thread:** at block start `patch.osc[o].table = slot[o].live.load(acquire)` before
  `setPatch` (Synth uses the pointer only inside `render`), `epoch.fetch_add(1)` after the block.
  No locks, no frees, no allocation.
- Status line while busy: `LOADING <name>`; on failure `MISSING <name>` for a few seconds.

## 4. Faster, smaller import (do first)

Measured: a 256-frame table took **582 ms and 22 MB** on the Force. Targets: < 150 ms, < 10 MB.

### 4.1 Shorter high mip levels
Level k holds H_k = 1024 >> k harmonics. Linear interpolation needs ~8 samples per cycle of the
top harmonic to stay clean, so store level k at N_k = clamp(8 · H_k, 256, 2048):

| level k | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5..10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| harmonics | 1024 | 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32..1 |
| samples | 2048 | 2048 | 2048 | 1024 | 512 | 256 |

9,216 samples per frame instead of 22,528: **2.4× less memory** (22 → ~9.2 MB) and ~2.6× less
inverse-FFT work. Levels 0–2 are unchanged (no quality change where it is audible).

Code changes: `Wavetable` gets per-level offsets and bit widths (`kMipBits[k]`,
`kMipOffset[k]`, frame stride = Σ(N_k + 1)); `Synth::renderOsc` uses
`idx = ph >> (32 - bits)`, `frac = (ph & mask) * 2^-(32 - bits)` with that level's `bits`;
tests check the guard sample at each level's own length.

### 4.2 Two frames per FFT
Two real signals fit one complex FFT. Forward: put frame a in the real part and frame b in the
imaginary part; then A[h] = (X[h] + conj X[N−h]) / 2, B[h] = (X[h] − conj X[N−h]) / 2i.
Inverse: X = S_a + i·S_b → `ifft(X)` = a + i·b. Halves the FFT count for import and for the
built-ins. Process frames in pairs (an odd last frame pairs with silence).

Together about 5× → **~115 ms** expected on the Force. Measure before/after with
`make bench-device` (it times `pfbench -t` on a 256-frame table).

## 5. Steal modes

New enum parameter `steal`, options `Oldest · Quietest · Keep low · Keep high`, default Oldest.
`Patch::steal`; `Synth::victim()` switches on it. Only voices below the `Voices` limit count.

| Mode | Picks |
|---|---|
| Oldest | the voice started first (`age`, wrap-safe `int32_t(a - b) < 0`) |
| Quietest | released voices (`!gate && !sustained`) first, the quietest `env[0].v`; else the quietest held voice |
| Keep low | oldest among all except the lowest-sounding note |
| Keep high | oldest among all except the highest-sounding note |

UI: an `enum_v` "STEAL" in the ENV page's OUTPUT frame
(VOLUME and VOICES knobs side by side at cx ≈ 1013 / 1168, the enum below).
Tests (on `Synth` directly): Oldest steals the first note; Keep low/high keep a held low/high
note through 9 more notes; Quietest steals a released voice before any held one.
Later (Milestone 2): a ~3 ms fade before a stolen voice restarts.

## 6. Touchscreen

### 6.1 Table steppers (option A), OSC page
- `o1_wave`/`o2_wave` enums go; in their place (cy = frame top + 44, cx ≈ 740, w ≈ 700, h = 44):
  `stepper key=o1_table` with params `o1_table` (0..1023, `display:"string"`, `type:"stepper"`,
  not automatable) and momentaries `o1_table_prev` / `o1_table_next`. Same for osc 2.
- Text: `Analog / Jupiter 8 Saw` (`LOADING …` while it loads).
- **Stepping = one table per event**, whatever MPC's delta (Q-Link detent 1/128, wheel click
  0.01, touch drag ≈ 0.04, fast spins send 1–3 detents): RackForce's `stepItem()` rule.
  `|n − ours| ≤ kQuant` (0.0015, MPC rounds to 1/1000) = our own value echoed back, ignore;
  otherwise move ±1 in the direction of travel, clamped to the flat list. Constants from
  RackForce: `kQuant 0.0015`, `kGestureMs 300`, `kFirstMoveMax 0.16`.
- Position knob display becomes `FRAME 37 / 256` (`dynamic_display`; frame count from the slot).

### 6.2 Browser page `TABLES` (option B)
Layout (1280 × 800 layout coordinates, plugin area y = 86..714):

| Element | Widget / params |
|---|---|
| status line | existing readout, top |
| target oscillator | `enum_h key=br_osc` options `OSC 1, OSC 2` |
| categories | `list cols=2 rows=8 key=cat` → `cat_1..cat_16`, options `["-","On"]`, `dynamic_display`; `cat_prev`/`cat_next` momentaries if > 16 categories |
| tables | `list cols=3 rows=8 key=tbl` → `tbl_1..tbl_24`, same kind; `tbl_prev`/`tbl_next` momentaries; readout `tbl_page` "PAGE 2 / 4" |
| now loaded | readout `br_now`: `OSC 1: Analog / Jupiter 8 Saw · 256 frames` |
| actions | `toggle key=fav` (lit = current table is a favorite), buttons `rnd` (RANDOM), `copy` (COPY 1 > 2), `swap` (SWAP 1 <> 2) |

- A `list` tile shows its param's **display text** (Value label) and is lit when its value is 1.
  We set the loaded table's tile to 1 and the others to 0, and push changes ourselves.
- Tap = load into the target oscillator (debounce still applies, 150 ms).
- **Bounce rule:** MPC sends a second toggle ~0.7 s after a tap; ignore a revert within 1 s
  (RackForce `toggleBounce`).
- The browser follows the target oscillator: when its table changes (stepper, random, a project
  load), select that table's category and page.
- Q-Links on this page: `o1_table, o2_table, o1_pos, o2_pos, f1_cut, f2_cut, …` so a knob scrolls
  and auditions while the page is open.

### 6.3 Push mechanics (port of RackForce's `Surface::notify`)
- Arrays `want_[NPARAMS]` (what MPC should show) / `shown_[NPARAMS]` (what it last saw),
  `release_[]` for momentaries (spring back to 0), `textGen_` bumped whenever any dynamic text
  changes.
- From `processReplacing` only: `audioMasterAutomate` for changed values, at most **48 per
  block** (round-robin cursor); `audioMasterUpdateDisplay` at most every **4 blocks** when
  `textGen_` moved. **Never call the host from `setParameter` or the dispatcher.**
- MPC doesn't notice engine-side value changes (tile lit states, stepper position) unless
  they're automated, and doesn't re-read names/texts without UpdateDisplay.
- Momentaries fire on every press (a 1). As first built they fired on the rising edge only
  (`held_[]`), and on the first device run (2026-10-05) buttons stopped working after one press:
  a tap toggles the value MPC read back, a button reads back 0, so MPC never sends the release
  that would re-arm it.
- Parameter count after this milestone: ~101 (44 − 2 + 59). No MPC limit is known (a catalog
  plugin declares 669).

## 7. Favorites, Recent, Random, Copy, Swap

- **Favorites:** a process-wide set of keys, saved to `<plugin dir>/favorites.txt` (one key per
  line) on every toggle; read at library build. Shared by every project. Test override:
  `PF_DATA_DIR`.
- **Recent:** the last 12 loaded keys, newest first, in `recent.txt` next to it.
- **Random:** a random table from the browser's current category (pseudo-categories included),
  never the one already loaded, into the target oscillator.
- **Copy 1 > 2:** osc 2 gets osc 1's key (cache hit: instant). **Swap:** exchange the keys.

## 8. State

- Chunk (`polyforce 2`) gains `o1_table=<key>` and `o2_table=<key>`: string values, the only
  non-numeric lines; written from `wantKey`. Missing lines (older states) → `builtin:Classic`.
- `steal=<index>` like any enum.
- The `o1_table` param value (an index) is derived from the key after every library change,
  never saved.
- Risk to check with a trace on the device: if MPC calls `setParameter` with stored values
  right after `effSetChunk`, the relative stepping in §6.1 must see them as echoes. They equal
  our read-back, so they should be; confirm.

## 9. Tests to add

- Library: with `PF_TABLE_ROOTS=../wavetables`, categories = Built-in + the 11 ESW folders;
  `ESW Analog - ` prefix stripped; flat order stable; keys round-trip to paths.
- Loader: stepper next → `LOADING` → loaded (poll with timeout); a project chunk with
  `o1_table=` restores in a fresh instance; a missing key → Classic + `MISSING`, key kept in
  the saved state; scrolling 30 steps fast loads only the last table (count loads).
- Handoff: under ASan, swap tables while blocks render on another thread for a few seconds
  (catches use-after-free).
- Browser: category tap fills tiles; table tap loads into the target; lit tile pushed via
  `audioMasterAutomate` (the fake host records it); bounce within 1 s ignored.
- Favorites/Recent files written under `PF_DATA_DIR`; random never repeats the current table;
  copy/swap.
- Steal modes as in §5.
- Import: `test-tables` still all 379 OK; loads at least 3× faster than today on x86
  (334 ms average before).
